affects the emotions of people who experience it Artists express themselves by their art Some people find art relaxing Many people disagree on how to define art Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity Art includes drawing painting sculpting photography Performing arts performance art dance music poetry prose and theatre Types of art Art is divided into the plastic arts where something is made and the performing arts where something is done by humans in action The other division is between pure arts done for themselves and practical arts done for a practical purpose but with artistic content Plastic arts Fine art is expression by making something Beauty beautiful or appealing to the emotion s by visual means drawing painting printmaking sculpture Literature poetry creative writing Performing arts Performing art including drama are expression using the body dance acting singing Auditory art expression by making sound s music singing Practical arts Culinary art expression by making flavor s and taste s cooking The practical arts expression by making things and structures architecture Movie filming fashion photography video games What art means Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the mind human mind spirit and soul An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people the number of people who can relate to it and how much they appreciate it The first and broadest sense of art means arrangement or to arrange In this sense art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design Art may express emotion Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience However if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well then the art work may become publicly successful History of art There are sculptures cave painting and rock art dating from the Upper Paleolithic era All of the great ancient civilizations such as Ancient Egypt India China Greece Rome or Arabia had works and styles of art In the Middle Ages most of the art in Europe showed people from the Bible in painting s stained glass windows and mosaic tile floors and walls Islamic art includes geometric patterns Islamic calligraphy and architecture In India and Tibet painted sculptures dance and religious painting were done In China arts included jade carving bronzework pottery poetry calligraphy music painting drama and fiction There are many Chinese artistic styles which are usually named after the ruling dynasty In Europe after the Middle Ages there was a Renaissance which means rebirth People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures but they also now could paint mythological pictures too These artists also invented perspective graphical perspective where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other In the late 1800s artists in Europe responding to Industrialization Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism Romanticism Realism and Impressionism The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism Fauvism Cubism Dada ism Surrealism and Minimalism Roles of art In some society societies people think that art belongs to the person who made it such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art They think that the artist put his or her talent into the art In this view the art is the property of the artist In other societies people think that art belongs to no one They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist s work In this view society is a collective that has made the art through the artist Functions of art The wikt simple function functions of art include ref cite book last Bagdasaryan first Nadejda title Culturology year 2000 language Russian ISBN 5 06 003475 5 pages 511 chapter
